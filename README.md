# Intro_To_R_Workshop
 Basic "Intro to R and R Studio" workshop I put together for undergrads. This is meant to work both as a workshop and something students can work through at their own pace.
 If you'd like to work through this, I'd recommend cloning this repository and starting with the PDF labeled "00_Getting_Started_With_R.pdf".
